Image Captioning with Deep Learning

This repository contains code for an image captioning system using deep learning techniques. The system utilizes a combination of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to generate descriptive captions for input images.

Overview :
Image captioning is a challenging task that requires understanding both visual content and natural language. This project aims to address this task by leveraging deep learning models and techniques.

Key Components :
InceptionV3 Model: Pre-trained deep learning model used for feature extraction from images.
Language Model: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells used for caption generation.
Tokenizer: Preprocessing component used to tokenize and encode textual data (captions).
Training Pipeline: Workflow for training the model using extracted image features and preprocessed captions.
Evaluation: Evaluation of the trained model using BLEU scores to measure the quality of generated captions.
